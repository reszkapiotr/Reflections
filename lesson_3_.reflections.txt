When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm not using same computer, some people are working on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It wouldn't be efficent to do it automatically. If I don't finish  my f.e. whole new future yet I don't want this to be seen by everybody. I made some commits but I haven't done my new feauture yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork should be used when we don't need to make changes on somebodies repository, clone when would be pushed (if I hava authorisation) would change somebodies repository. Branch is pretty different from those two... I don't know right now how to compare those.
